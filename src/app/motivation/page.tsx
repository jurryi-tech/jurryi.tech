              After spending a year working inside the patent industry, one thing became painfully clear to me:{" "}

                I was kicked out of my previous company &ldquo;Inventip Legal&rdquo; for discussing AI usage for patent drafting and for helping assignees with a genuine approach for early detection of rejection scenarios while drafting patents. The argument was simply &mdash; &ldquo;Why not avoid any chances of rejection at the time of drafting, rather than waiting for prosecution? Why not give genuine feedback to inventors for their inventions than giving fake hopes of a successful grant after 18 months?&rdquo;

              The entire ecosystem is built to extract money from inventors, not to help them succeed.

            <p className="font-sans text-lg leading-[1.9] text-[#3A3A3A]">
              Drafting a single patent costs thousands of dollars, and the service-based industry is structured around maximizing billable hours, not maximizing grant outcomes.

            <p className="font-sans text-lg leading-[1.9] text-[#3A3A3A]">
              Inventors pour years into their ideas, only to be handed drafts that don&apos;t faithfully represent their inventions. And they wouldn&apos;t even know, because there&apos;s no honest review layer telling them what went wrong.

              Grants are brutally hard to obtain, not because the inventions aren&apos;t worthy, but because inventors lack strategic guidance. They don&apos;t have an unbiased partner who can tell them honestly:{" "}

              <em>&ldquo;this description doesn&apos;t match your disclosure,&rdquo;</em>{" "}

              One that drafts faithfully, reviews without bias, protects their data completely, and makes high-quality patent prosecution accessible to everyone &mdash; not just those who can afford $15,000 per application.
